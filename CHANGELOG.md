## [v2.9.6] - 2026-01-05

### Changed
- **CLI Refinement:** Renamed `tb web --persist` to `tb web --session` for better semantic clarity.
- **Documentation:** Updated README with project screenshots.

## [v2.9.4] - 2026-01-05
### Added
- **Session Persistence:** `tb web --persist` now uses `tmux` to keep your web terminal alive after disconnect.
- **Status Bar:** Added a built-in shortcut cheat sheet to the bottom of persistent web sessions.

## [v2.9.3] - 2026-01-05

## [v2.9.2] - 2026-01-05
### Changed
- **Web Terminal:** Simplified `tb web` to run Fish directly, fixing input latency and focus issues on mobile browsers.

### Added
- **`tb web`:** New command to expose your Termux terminal over a local web URL for laptop access.

## [v2.8.1] - 2026-01-05
### Fixed
- **Sync Persistence:** `tb sync` now automatically re-runs setup logic (refresh mode) to ensure new configurations (aliases, completions) are applied immediately after an update.

## [v2.8.0] - 2026-01-05
### Added
- **Fish Completions:** Added Tab autocomplete support for the `tb` command (update, sync, theme, help).

## [v2.7.1] - 2026-01-05
### Changed
- **CLI Split:** Separated `tb update` (Full System Update) and `tb sync` (Script Sync Only) for better control.

## [v2.7.0] - 2026-01-05
### Added
- **`tb theme`:** Introduced an interactive theme switcher with popular color schemes (Dracula, Nord, Gruvbox, Matrix).

## [v2.6.0] - 2026-01-05
### Added
- **First Run Tour:** A welcoming guide that appears on the first shell launch to help new users get started.

## [v2.5.0] - 2026-01-05
### Changed
- **CLI Manager:** Introduced `tb.sh` as the core logic engine.

- **Deployment:** Fixed `curl | bash` compatibility for Fish/Zsh users.

## [v2.4.4] - 2026-01-05
### Fixed
- **One-Liner Persistence:** The installer now silently clones the repo if run via pipe, ensuring `uninstall.sh` and `tb update` work later.

## [v2.4.2] - 2026-01-05
### Added
- **Smart Greeting:** Replaced empty shell greeting with a subtle `tb` reminder.
